# Shares

Shares is a microservice based system, designed to allow me to track what shares I have bought and sold. Overengineered from the get go, I'm using .NET Core microservices following domain-driven design and CQRS design patterns, alongside gRPC for communication between services - then an interface build using Angular 9 + TypeScript. ...could've just used a spreadsheet.
